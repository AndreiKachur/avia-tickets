It is based on the following:

-React  
-Redux  
-SCSS  

Third-party Services:

-react-scroll-up  
-react-spinners  
-react-icons   

Besides I used json-server, BEM-methodology.  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]  
(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run project:

-npm install  
-npm run json-server  
-npm start
